## Cartesian-graphing-of-prime-factorization

Following a middle school idea of advancing from an origin, vectors representing different prime factors of a number, obtaining an m dimensionally represented diagram for m prime factors. Given an initial integer, it builds a graph based on prime factorization with each cartesian vector based on a unique divisor.

I wish to make it stereographic, to have two side by side from apparently different points of view.


### History

The idea stems from middle school when the idea was introduced to cartesian graphing recurring divisions by prime divisors. At the time I thought it was very cool, the resulting n-D graph. I finally put it to code ~2017, and here it is, pretty much a copy of the initial code!
